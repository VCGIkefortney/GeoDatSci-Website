                  <strong>Storytelling in Data Science</strong> - <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#s16">John Stanton-Geddes</a>
                  The field of data science has grown explosively in the last decade. With humble roots in statistics, decision sciences, computer science, and economics, there are now data scientists in nearly every realm, from business to government. Yet, for the popularity of data science, most people in the field can’t agree what defines data science. My opinion is that the success of data science is telling a story, and supporting it with data, analysis and visualization, as shown by the popularity of tools like Tableau, d3js, JuPyter notebooks and rmarkdown. However, the nature of telling stories is that sometimes we want to believe the story, and find the data to support it. This belief comes at a risk as the hype around data science makes people prone to believing that results are true, even when they may not be. Mistakes are costly, and will undermine the value of data science.

                  <strong>Assembling MIRE Data - The Vermont Experience A look into the development of GIS-base intersection data</strong> - <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#s17">Johnathan Croft</a>
                  The Mapping Section at the Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) is working with the VTrans Office of Highway Safety in the development of the MIRE data model to meet federal requirements and support the Safety Analyst application.  Much of the data exists, but not in the necessary formats, but there are some significant gaps.  Intersection data was one such dataset that was absent at VTrans and required significant effort to evaluate and develop. <p>The presentation will discuss the development of the intersection data, review of the other DOT intersection data models, prototyping the intersection data, and steps toward implementation which includes using the data within Safety Analyst.

                  <strong>3D Data Visualization for Contaminated  Sites</strong> - <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#s18">Kelsey Tobin</a>
                  Data visualization is an indispensable tool for understanding the nature and extent of contamination at contaminated sites. Such sites, especially large and heavily contaminated areas like superfund sites, have often been studied for long periods of time, and have decades’ worth of historical data for contaminant concentrations in soil, water, air, etc. Unfortunately, these data are often contained in myriad reports, maps, and files in various formats, from multiple labs and companies, and with varying degrees of legibility and data completeness. In addition, it is difficult to visualize years’ worth of data (often hundreds of samples) on traditional static maps, especially when the contamination at many sites is a complex 3-dimensional problem involving geology, groundwater flow, multiple contaminants, and multiple sources of contamination. To solve all of these problems, Stone Environmental has developed a systematic way of compiling all historic data into a single comprehensive site database and visualizing that data in 3D models and with ArcGIS online. These tools allow us to visualize highly complex and detailed sites in intuitive and data-rich formats that are easier to use, share, understand, and present than traditional methods.

We started off with basic queries (presented last year) and now we’re seeing results of the automation work accomplished with simple tools like Git, Jenkins, and Datagrip with languages like SQL and Python. Today a user needs to only know 2 pieces of information to kick off a series of queries that can reduce the amount of time reviewing the quality of a product from multiple hours to multiple seconds. As the data portfolio grows, the quality department can tackle a greater number of data products of increased size in a reasonable amount of time.

                  <strong>Vermont Agency of Transportation's Flood Resilience Planning Tool: UX Design for Data-Rich Applications</strong> - <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#s22">Roger Branon Rodriguez</a>
                  In 2011, flooding from hurricane Irene damaged numerous roads, bridges and culverts throughout Vermont, isolating six communities from access to any road. To improve resiliency planning for the state’s transportation network and it’s connected communities, the Vermont Agency of Transportation worked with a team led by Milone & MacBroom to model vulnerability, risk, and mitigation strategies for infrastructure. Based on vulnerability assessment and transportation modeling results for three of the most impacted watersheds, Stone designed and developed a web application to illustrate the rich data results for varying flood scenarios. During this talk, UX Developer Roger Branon Rodriguez will demo the application, with a focus on UX Design & Development for data-rich applications.

                  ISciences' open-source Water Security Indicator Model (WSIM) monitors and forecasts global environmental conditions relevant to human security. Each month, the model predicts variables such as soil moisture, runoff, and evapotranspiration at lead times up to 9 months, using data from NOAA's Climate Forecast System. Results are statistically analyzed to compute indices of overall water surplus and deficit that place conditions in a historical context. This presentation will provide an overview of the model and the open-source components upon which it is built.

                  In 2022, NGS will be replacing the US horizontal and vertical datums (NAD 83 and NAVD 88).  This workshop is designed to discuss the need and process for these changes, as well as how that affects positioning professionals and their access to these datums.  We will begin with a discussion of the history of the North American Datum of 1983 and the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, their relationships to other reference frames, and the reasons for their ongoing evolution. We will also discuss the relationships of geoid models to various versions of NAD 83, and what can happen should these relationships be ignored.  Finally, we will discuss what activities are being undertaken to ensure a smooth transition.

                  <strong>Is spatial still special? Perspectives on the implications of Data Science and its tools for Geoanalytics and the Geoprofession </strong> - <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#s04">David Breeding</a>
                  Is spatial analysis still special? Are geoanalytics more than analysis that uses location as a variable? Is the explosion of data science and its tools changing our GIS industry? If you answered “Yes” to any of those questions, this presentation is for you. As geospatial professionals, we may wonder:  Are my geo-skills losing value in our increasingly data science driven world?  My answer to this is absolutely not!  However, to stay relevant, we need to adjust and adapt. We need to adjust our ways of thinking about how our geospatial perspective fits within the larger context of data science, big data, the Internet of Things (IoT), and AI and machine learning. This presentation will describe a variety of sample geoanalytics casework and tools. The goal is to stimulate your thinking about how data science is changing our geoprofession, and to compare notes on what’s in (or should be in) the toolbox of a next generation geoprofessional.

                  To effectively support positive youth development, it is essential for young people, their families, and their allies to have the appropriate information on the array of services and resources that are available to them. This presentation will focus on the methods and techniques that went into identifying the pertinent data to collect from resource providers to help reduce access barriers.  During this project subject experts conducted a series of focus groups to more fully understand what young people are interested in knowing about a service prior to engaging with the resource. This intelligence was then used to inform the survey questions to youth resource providers and the data aggregation into a meaningful information system to help Vermont 14-22 age group identify and connect with available resources.

                  <strong>Citizen Archeology and Geology - The Burlington Ravine</strong> - <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#s11">Hugo Martinez Cazon</a>
                  Using an early sewer map held at Library of Congress, and digital mapping both in Google Earth and GIS it was possible to show that Burlington was originally crossed by a 1.5 mile ravine.The current drive for urban cultural reconnection to landscape and to food production involves reconsideration of the relationship with land. <p> Burlington Vermont social history has few records of the natural landscape of the city.  A review of city and university held information revealed land ownership maps, but no pre urbanization topography.  The map, supplemented by news stories and images, allowed verification of the ravine’s existence.<p>
                  The ravine plays a vital role in the land development history of Burlington, and influenced the social life that identifies the city.  City street and sewer layout is explained by the course of the ravine.<p>The research for the ravine, uncovered the relevance Burlington has in the creation of modern winter sports, in the early development of new apple varietals, and how the city inspired the creator of American Landscape Architecture, Fredrick Law Olmstead.  Ultimately the mapping suggests the possibility of pre-European, Abenaki, settlement.

                  In 2017, Ms. Adams facilitated student exploration into geospatial data related to livability. Her team was interested in quantifying what makes a location a desirable destination for young people. In this session, Ms. Adams describes how technical challenges and missing data gave rise to artistic solutions, and how their exploration culminated in an installation at Champlain College's Emergent Media Center that curated itself through discussion and participation.
